# Change log for the Intune Data Warehouse API

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Keep current on updates to the Intune Data Warehouse.

## 1903
_Released March 2019_

### V1.0 changes reflecting back to beta
When V1.0 was first introduced in 1808, it differed in some significant ways from the beta API. In 1903 those changes will be reflected back into the beta API version. If you have important reports that use the beta API version, we strongly recommend switching those reports to V1.0 to avoid breaking changes. Please refer to [API version information](reports-api-url.md) for more information on Data Warehouse API versions and backwards compatibility. 

## 1902 
_Released February 2019_

### Power BI Compliance app 

Access your Intune Data Warehouse in Power BI Online using the [Intune Compliance (Data Warehouse)](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/getapps/services/Intune_dw_compliance) app. With this Power BI app, you can now access and share pre-created reports without any setup and without leaving your web browser. 

## 1812 
_Released December 2018_

### Enrollment Activities Collection Released to v1.0 

The Enrollment Activities collection is now available in v1.0. You can use this collection to understand enrollment failure volume and trends in your environment. For more information, see [enrollmentActivities](intune-data-warehouse-collections.md#enrollmentactivities), [enrollmentEventStatuses](intune-data-warehouse-collections.md#enrollmenteventstatuses), [enrollmentFailureCategories](intune-data-warehouse-collections.md#enrollmentfailurecategories), and [enrollmentFailureReasons](intune-data-warehouse-collections.md#enrollmentfailurereasons).

## 1808
_Released August 2018_

### v1.0 Collections  

You can now use the v1.0 version of the Intune Data Warehouse by setting the query parameter `api-version=v1.0`. Updates to collections in the Data Warehouse are additive in nature and do not break existing scenarios.

### Enrollment Activities Collection Released to Beta

The new `Enrollment Activities` collection is released to beta. You can use this collection to understand how your enrollment is proceeding by viewing the most common failures. 


## 1805
_Released May 2018_

### Correction to device count in **Devices** collection 

A fix has been made to the **Devices** collection which may lower total device counts that filter by the attribute `isDeleted`. This drop is a result of the correction and is not an error. For more information regarding the **Devices** collection, see [Reference for device entities](reports-ref-devices.md). 


## 1801
_Released January 2018_

### Intune Data Warehouse application-only authentication <!-- 1867540 -->

You can set up an application using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and authenticate to the Intune Data Warehouse. For more information see, [Intune Data Warehouse application-only authentication](data-warehouse-app-only-auth.md).

### Azure AD and Intune credential requirements <!-- 2077525 -->

- An Intune license is no longer required to be assigned to the user when accessing the Intune Data Warehouse (including the API).
- The Intune role name has been changed from **Reports** to **Intune data warehouse**. 

    For more information, see [Azure AD and Intune credential requirements](reports-api-url.md#azure-ad-and-intune-credential-requirements).

### OData query options <!-- 2077711 -->

You can use <code>$select</code> as an OData query parameter. The current version supports the following OData query parameters: <code>$filter</code>, <code>$orderby</code>, <code>$select</code>, <code>$skip</code>, and <code>$top</code>. For more information, see [OData query options](reports-api-url.md#odata-query-options).

### New entities in the in Data Warehouse data model <!-- 2077804 -->

 - The entity, [**MobileAppDeviceuserInstallStatus**](reports-ref-application.md), has been added. The **MobileAppDeviceUserInstallStatus** represents a mobile app install status for a given device and user.
 - The entity, [**MobileAppInstallState**](reports-ref-application.md#mobileappinstallstate), has been added. The **MobileAppInstallState** entity represents the install state for a mobile application after it has been assigned to a group containing devices, users, or both. 

## 1710
_Released November  2017_

### A new entity collection named Current User is limited to currently active user data <!-- 1544273 -->

The **Users** entity collection contains all the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users with assigned licenses in your enterprise. These records include user states during the data collection period, even if the user has been removed. For example, a user may be added to Intune and then removed during the course of the last month. While this user is not present at the time of the report, the user and state are present in the data. You could create a report that would show the duration of the user's historic presence in your data.

In contrast, the new **Current User** entity collection only contains users who have not been removed. The **Current User** entity collection only contains currently active users. For information about the **current user** entity collection, see [Reference for current user entity](reports-ref-current-user.md).

## 1709
_Released October  2017_

### User device association entity collection added to Intune Data Warehouse data model <!-- 1187917 -->

You can now build reports and data visualizations using the user device association information that associates user and device entity collections. The data model can be accessed through the Power BI file (PBIX) retrieved from the Data Warehouse Intune page, through the OData endpoint, or by developing a custom client. For more information, see the [User Device Association](reports-ref-user-device.md).

### New entities in the in Data Warehouse data model <!-- 1479526 --><!-- -->

 - The entity, [**UserDeviceAssociation**](reports-ref-user-device.md), added. **UserDeviceAssociation** contains user device associations in your organization. You can now build reports and data visualizations using the user device association information that associates user and device entity collections.  
 - The entity, [**IntuneManagementExtension**](reports-ref-intunemanagementextension.md), added. **IntuneManagementExtension** contains entities for mobile devices that track information such as version and installation status.
